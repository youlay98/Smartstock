## Introduction

This library enables clients to connect to STOMP brokers over WebSocket (or TCP). It fully implements the STOMP protocol specifications (v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2), making it compatible with any broker that supports STOMP or STOMP over WebSocket.

Popular brokers like RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and others provide support for STOMP and STOMP over WebSockets out-of-the-box.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive API for interacting with the STOMP protocol
- Support for STOMP protocol versions: **1.2**, **1.1**, and **1.0**
- Support for fallback options  when WebSocket is unavailable
- Supports both **browser** and **Node.js** environments
- Option to connect using **STOMP over TCP**
- Full support for **binary payloads**
- Compatible with RxJS for reactive programming

## Getting Started

This section provides a quick guide to integrating STOMP.js into your **browser** or **Node.js** application.

### Browser

To use STOMP.js in a browser:

1. Add the following in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script type="importmap">
     {
       "imports": {
         "@stomp/stompjs": "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@stomp/stompjs@7.0.0/esm6/index.js"
       }
     }
   </script>
   <script
     async
     src="https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@1.5.1/dist/es-module-shims.js"
     crossorigin="anonymous"
   ></script>
   ```

2. Use the library:
   ```javascript
   import { Client } from '@stomp/stompjs';

   const client = new Client({
     brokerURL: 'ws://localhost:15674/ws',
     onConnect: () => {
       client.subscribe('/topic/test01', message =>
         console.log(`Received: ${message.body}`)
       );
       client.publish({ destination: '/topic/test01', body: 'First Message' });
     },
   });

   client.activate();
   ```

### Node.js

To use STOMP.js in a Node.js environment:

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm install @stomp/stompjs ws
   ```

2. Use it in your application:
   ```javascript
   import { Client } from '@stomp/stompjs';

   import { WebSocket } from 'ws';
   Object.assign(global, { WebSocket });

   const client = new Client({
     brokerURL: 'ws://localhost:15674/ws',
     onConnect: () => {
       client.subscribe('/topic/test01', message =>
         console.log(`Received: ${message.body}`)
       );
       client.publish({ destination: '/topic/test01', body: 'First Message' });
     },
   });

   client.activate();
   ```
